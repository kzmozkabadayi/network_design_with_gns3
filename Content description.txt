The content of the project continues as follows:
-Our company has 3 buildings. These buildings include factory building, office building and branch building. 
-We need to provide a network in each of these buildings. 
-First of all, our factory building has 3 floors. 8 Ethernet ports are required on each level. 
-The office building has 2 floors and we need to provide 2 Ethernet to them.
-I did this job with a router.
-Finally, a connection to the remote branch building is required.
-But since it is far away, I provided it with modems and created it.
-After creating this design, I pinged between computers to test connections. 
-I have shared them in the attachment.
